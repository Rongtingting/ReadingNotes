## Background

Every cell is uniqueâ€”it occupies an exclusive position in space, carries distinct errors in its copied genome and is subject to programmed and induced changes in gene expression. Yet most DNA and RNA sequencing is performed on tissue samples or cell populations, in which biological differences between cells can be obscured by averaging or mistaken for technical noise.
