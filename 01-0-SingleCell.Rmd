[The triumphs and limitations of computational methods for scRNA-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01171-x)[@kharchenko2021triumphs]

Though computational approaches vary, most formulate (1) a statistical model of the measurement, (2) a representation of the data in reduced dimensions, and (3) an approximation of the expression manifold (Box 2), with a set of discrete transcriptional subpopulations being the simplest and the most common approximation. The problems motivating these steps, and the specific solutions and their assumptions, are the subject of this review.

a, Beating Moore's law. The number of cells measured by landmark scRNA-seq datasets over years (red), compared with the increase in the CPU transistor counts (black). The set of all published scRNA-seq studies83 is shown with small red dots. The estimated number of cells in a human body is shown by a green dashed line. 
b, Shallow coverage of each cell can be compensated for by measuring more cells. The ability to distinguish two cell populations, assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) measure, is shown as a function of the number of measured cells (x axis) and the mean cell depth (y axis). Examples of three different simulations (1-3) within different parts of this design parameter space are shown on PCA projections. 
c, Probabilistic view of scRNA-seq estimates. Posterior probability of IL32 gene expression magnitude is shown for five cells from two different CD8+ T cell populations (red and blue, thin lines). Joint posteriors assessing the mean expression magnitude within each subpopulation are shown by thick dashed lines. 
d, Comparing CD4+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes, the plot shows the number (y axis, left) and the fraction (y axis, right) of the genes passing a 1% statistical significance threshold for differential expression (DE) as a function of the number of cells compared from each population (x axis). 
e, The scatter plot shows for each gene (dots) the mean (x axis) and variance (y axis) of the normalized UMI counts (CPM, counts per million) in CD4+ T cells. The Poisson expected value is shown in green, with a quadratic-based negative binomial fit shown in red. f-i, Variance normalization and most variable genes. 
f, A t-SNE embedding of a primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) dataset with cell annotations. NK, natural killer, separated into CD56 bright and dim subsets. pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell. 
g, Mean-variance relationship of different genes (dots) in the PBMC dataset is shown for log-transformed expression estimates. The genome-wide relationship, as captured by smoothed regression, is shown by the blue line. Genes whose variance is significantly higher than the genome-wide trend are shown as red dots. 
h, Residual variance is shown for the top 5,000 overdispersed genes, ordered by the statistical significance (x axis). 
i, Expression pattern of several example genes, with circles highlighting the subpopulations distinguished by the genes. 
j, Distribution of normalized expression magnitudes (CPM) for the CTSH gene across all CD14+ monocytes is shown on the linear scale (top) and after log transformation (bottom) with a pseudocount.
