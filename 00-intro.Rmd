## Rongting Reading Notes

Welcome to my **Reading Notes Notebook**, a collection of summaries, insights, and references from all the papers I've read or followed during my research journey. This notebook serves as both a reference for my work and a resource for anyone interested in the fields I've explored.

## **About This Notebook**
This notebook spans my academic and research career across three major fields:

1. **Post-translational Modifications (PTMs)** during my Master's research.

2. **Single-cell Genomics** during my PhD work.

3. **Spatial Biology** in my postdoctoral studies.

Each section is organized to reflect the progression of my studies and the papers that have influenced my understanding and contributions to these areas.

## **Topics Covered**
**Post-translational Modifications (PTMs)**

PTMs are key processes in molecular biology, providing functional diversity to proteins. My Master's research focused on understanding their roles in:

- Cellular signaling pathways.

- Disease mechanisms.

- Protein interactions and modifications.

**Single-cell Genomics**

During my PhD, I dove deep into the world of single-cell genomics, exploring:

- Advanced technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

- Computational tools for analyzing single-cell data, especially in CNV detection.

- The heterogeneity of cell populations.

- Applications in cancer research, immunology, and developmental biology.

**Spatial Biology**

In my postdoc, my focus shifted to spatial biology, which combines spatial context with molecular data to provide a deeper understanding of:

- Tissue architecture and microenvironments.

- Spatial transcriptomics and proteomics.

- Cutting-edge imaging and sequencing technologies.

## **How to Use This Notebook**

- **Papers:** Each section contains summaries, key findings, and my notes on the papers I've read in that area.

- **Resources:** Links to datasets, tools, and references used in the research are included.

- **Insights:** Personal reflections on how each paper has influenced my understanding or contributed to my own work.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or just curious about these fields, I hope this notebook serves as a helpful resource for learning and exploration.
